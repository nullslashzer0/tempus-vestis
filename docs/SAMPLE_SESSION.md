For your trip to San Antonio next week, you’ll be encountering warm and mostly sunny weather throughout your stay. Given the temperatures ranging from the mid-60s at night to the low to mid-90s during the day, it's essential to pack light, breathable clothing for daytime activities while ensuring you have layers for cooler evenings. Here’s a detailed packing list and wardrobe recommendations based on your trip duration and the weather forecast:

### Packing List for 5-7 Days:

#### Clothing:
1. **Tops (4-5)**:
   - **2-3 Short-Sleeve Blouses/Shirts**: Choose breathable fabrics like cotton or moisture-wicking blends.
   - **1-2 Light Long-Sleeve Tops**: For sun protection during the day and cooler evenings.

2. **Bottoms (2-3)**:
   - **1 Pair of Lightweight Shorts**: Comfortable and breathable for warm days.
   - **1 Pair of Lightweight Pants or Capris**: For evenings or cooler days; consider breathable fabric.
   - **1 Skirt or Dress**: Versatile for both casual outings and slightly dressier occasions.

3. **Shoes**:
   - **1 Pair of Comfortable Walking Shoes**: Ensure they are broken in for city exploration.
   - **1 Pair of Casual Sandals or Flip-Flops**: Great for relaxation and easy to slip on/off.

4. **Undergarments**:
   - Pack enough for each day plus 1 extra: **7 pairs of underwear** and **7 pairs of socks**.

5. **Layers**:
   - **1 Light Jacket or Cardigan**: A breathable layer for air-conditioned spaces and cool evenings.

6. **Accessories**:
   - **1 Sun Hat**: For sun protection during outdoor activities.
   - **Sunglasses**: To protect your eyes from the sun.
   - **Light Scarf or Shawl**: Useful for layering and can be stylish.

#### Toiletries:
- Travel-sized toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, toothpaste, sunscreen, deodorant, etc.)
- A small first aid kit (band-aids, pain relievers, etc.)

### Additional Recommendations:
- **Sun Protection**: Make sure to bring sunscreen with high SPF as well as a lip balm with SPF.
- **Hydration**: Consider packing a reusable water bottle to stay hydrated throughout your trip.
- **Day Bag**: A small day pack or crossbody bag for carrying essentials while exploring the city.

### Outfit Suggestions:
- **Daytime Outfit**: Lightweight shorts, a short-sleeve top, and comfortable walking shoes. Don't forget sunglasses and a sun hat.
- **Evening Outfit**: Lightweight pants or a skirt with a light long-sleeve top or cardigan; comfortable sandals for dining or evening strolls.

### Weather Considerations:
- Given that temperatures can vary significantly from day to night, layering is key. The light jacket or cardigan will be beneficial for evenings when temperatures drop to the mid-60s.
- Ensure that your clothing is made of breathable materials to keep you comfortable in the heat.

By following this packing list and these wardrobe recommendations, you'll be well-prepared for your trip to San Antonio, comfortable throughout the day, and stylish for your outings. Enjoy your trip!
